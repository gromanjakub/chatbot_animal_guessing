# Rasa chatbot - guessing an animal

This is a simple chatbot built using the Rasa framework.

The chatbot randomly chooses one of five animals - a cat, a dog, a snake, a parrot and a tardigrade.

The user then asks about the animal's color ("Is it brown?"), body parts ("Does it have fangs?"), behavior ("Does it bark?") and number of legs ("Does it have four legs?"), until the user is sure what animal the bot chose. Upon which the user may ask about the animal ("Is it a snake?").

Saying "Hi." starts a new game.
